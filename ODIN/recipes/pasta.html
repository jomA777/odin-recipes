    <h2>Description.</h2>
    <h3>This homemade pasta recipe is consistently great and easy to make with flour, eggs, salt, olive oil, and water. Roll out by hand or use a pasta machine to cut dough into desired pasta shape. Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</h3>
